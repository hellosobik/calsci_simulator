# Calsci Simulator

Calsci simulator is a program that mimics the behaviour of the calsci, allowing users to write application on the simulator without the requirement of a physical calsci device. 


## How to run
1. Run the `watcher.py` file. This script reruns the calsci simulator every time there is any changes in the codebase.

```bash
python watcher.py
```
